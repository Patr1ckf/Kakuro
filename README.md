# Kakuro Game in Java

This is a Java implementation of the classic Kakuro puzzle game, developed as a part of my university coursework. The game features board generation, solution verification, game saving, and the ability to print the board. It also employs a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzles, and leverages algebraic principles to ensure each puzzle has a unique solution.

## Features
- **Board Generation:** The game can generate Kakuro boards of various sizes and difficulties.
- **Solution Verification:** You can check your solution at any time to see if it's correct.
- **Game Saving:** You can save your progress at any point and continue later.
- **Board Printing:** The game allows you to print the current Kakuro board, which can be useful for offline solving or sharing with others.

## Algorithm
The game utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve Kakuro puzzles efficiently. This algorithm starts with an empty board and systematically fills in numbers while ensuring that each row and column follows the Kakuro rules. The algorithm provides a solution if one exists and informs the user if the puzzle is unsolvable or has multiple solutions. Algebraic concepts, particularly matrix theory, are employed to ensure that generated puzzles have a unique solution.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the university and the educators for providing the opportunity to work on this project and apply my knowledge in algorithm design and algebra to create this Kakuro game.

Feel free to improve and customize this game as you see fit. Enjoy playing and solving Kakuro puzzles!
